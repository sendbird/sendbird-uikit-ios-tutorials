# Integrate UIKit with an existing app

This folder contains the code before integrating the Sendbird UIKit with an existing app.
Update the code following the steps in the [tutorial page](https://sendbird.com/docs/chat/uikit/v3/ios/tutorial/integrate-with-existing-app).

**Please be cautious that you should replace `YOUR_APP_ID` with your actual Sendbird application ID,
and the `USER_ID` ID with the actual user ID.**

Check the `AppDelegate.swift` file to see the color values that are used in the project.
